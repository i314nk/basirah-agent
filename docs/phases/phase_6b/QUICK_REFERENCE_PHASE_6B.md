**Phase:** 6B - Advanced Screening Features
**Time Needed:** ~4 hours
**Strategic Value:** HIGH

---

## 🎯 What You're Building

### Feature 1: Enhanced Quick Screen ⚡

**Current Problem:**
- Quick Screen just says "AVOID/WATCH/BUY"
- No context on WHY
- Users don't know if they should spend $3-4 on deep dive

**Your Solution:**
```
⚡ WARREN'S QUICK SCREEN: AAPL

1. Business at a Glance
   [What Apple does in plain English]

2. Financial Health Snapshot
   Revenue: $391B | ROIC: 56% | Margin: 31%

3. Economic Moat (Quick Take)
   Strong brand, ecosystem lock-in, pricing power

4. Red Flags 🚩 & Green Flags ✅
   ✅ Exceptional returns
   ✅ Massive cash generation
   ⚠️ High debt worth investigating

5. My Deep Dive Recommendation
   🟢 INVESTIGATE
   
   This business has quality hallmarks worth
   investigating. The 7+ minutes reading full
   10-Ks would be time well spent.
   
   [Button: Run Deep Dive Analysis]

Length: ~800-1,000 words
Cost: $0.75-$1.50
Time: 2-3 minutes
```

**vs Poor Company:**
```
5. My Deep Dive Recommendation
   🔴 PASS
   
   ROIC of 8% (below 15% hurdle), declining
   margins, no moat. Not worth reading 200
   pages to confirm what's obvious from numbers.
   Better opportunities elsewhere.
```
